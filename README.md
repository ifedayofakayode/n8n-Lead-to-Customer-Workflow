# Lead-to-Customer Automation Workflow

## 📌 Overview

The **Lead-to-Customer Automation Workflow** is built in **n8n** to streamline lead management. It captures leads from forms, validates and enriches data, prevents duplicates, stores contacts in HubSpot CRM, and automates follow-ups.

This system reduces manual work, improves lead quality, and ensures timely engagement by the sales team.

## 📝 Detailed Description

Many organizations struggle with fragmented lead management and delayed follow-ups, leading to lost sales opportunities.

This automation provides an end-to-end solution by:

* Capturing leads from a web form (Typeform or n8n Webhook).
* Validating emails using **Hunter.io**.
* Enriching lead data with **Genderize.io**.
* Preventing duplicates with **Google Sheets**.
* Creating/updating contacts in **HubSpot CRM**.
* Routing leads intelligently (Senior vs. Junior Sales Rep).
* Sending automated **Thank You, Demo, and Reminder emails**.
* Creating tasks in **Trello/Asana** for assigned reps.
* Notifying sales teams in **Slack**.
* Logging and reporting every lead for analytics.
* Handling errors with retries and alerts.

**Business Value:** Saves 20+ hours per month, increases lead conversion by 15–25%, and improves response times.

## ⚙️ How It Works (Functionality)

### Workflow Steps

1. **Trigger:** Webhook / Typeform submission.
2. **Normalize Data:** Set node standardizes field names.
3. **Validate Email:** Hunter.io API checks validity.

   * If invalid → flag as `needsReview`.
4. **Enrich Data:** Genderize.io API predicts gender.
5. **Check Duplicates:** Google Sheets searches for existing email.

   * If found → update row.
   * If not found → append new row.
6. **CRM Entry:** HubSpot node creates/updates contact.

   * Retries up to **2 times** if failure.
7. **Conditional Routing:** IF node assigns to Senior vs. Junior rep.
8. **Task Creation:** Trello/Asana creates a follow-up task.
9. **Team Notification:** Slack posts enriched lead details.
10. **Email Automation (Gmail):**

    * Thank You email (Day 0).
    * Demo email if requested.
    * Welcome email if not.
    * Reminder email after 3 days (if no update).
11. **Reporting:** Google Sheets logs outcome.
12. **Error Handling:** Errors logged + Slack/Gmail alert.
13. **Daily Digest:** Slack summary of leads processed.

## 🧩 Branching Logic Example

```text
Webhook → Validate Email → Enrich Data → IF Enriched? 
   ├── YES → Deduplicate → HubSpot → IF Company Size
   │       ├── Large → Senior Rep → Task + Email + Slack
   │       └── Small → Junior Rep → Task + Email + Slack
   └── NO → Needs Review → Slack + Google Sheets
```

---

## 🛡 Retry & Error Handling

* **HubSpot & API Calls:** Retry up to **2 times** before failure.
* **Logging:** Errors appended to Google Sheets (timestamp, error type).
* **Alerts:** Critical failures send Slack alert + backup Gmail notification.
* **Fallback:** If enrichment fails → route lead to `#lead-review` channel.

---

## 📊 Reporting & Analytics

* **Google Sheets:** Logs each lead with enrichment status + outcome.
* **Slack Daily Digest:** Summarizes:

  * Total leads processed
  * Success count
  * Enrichment failures
  * Errors logged

---

## 🔄 Version & Updates

* **v1.0** – Initial workflow (Webhook → CRM → Slack → Email).

Would you like me to **add a Node Configuration Table** (Node | Purpose | Key Settings | API/Integration) inside this README so it becomes a quick setup reference for each n8n node?
